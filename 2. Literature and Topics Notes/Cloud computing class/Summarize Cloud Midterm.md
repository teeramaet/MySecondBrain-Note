## Characterstic of cloud
1. Cloud uses a shared pool of resources
2.  Uses Internet techn. to offer scalable and elastic services. 
3. The term “elastic computing” refers to the ability of dynamically and on-demand acquiring computing resources and supporting a variable workload. 
4. Resources are metered and users are charged accordingly. 
5. It is more cost-effective due to resource-multiplexing. Lower costs for the cloud service provider are past to the cloud users.  
6. Data is stored: 
	1. in the “cloud”, in certain cases closer to the site where it is used.
	2. appears to the users as if stored in a location-independent manner. 
7. The data storage strategy can increase reliability, as well as security, and can lower communication costs. Management: 
8. The maintenance and security are operated by service providers. 
9. The service providers can operate more efficiently due to specialisation and centralisation.

## Issue of cloud
1. Less Control 
	1. Many companies and governments are uncomfortable with the idea of their information located on systems they do not control. Providers must offer a high degree of security transparency to help put customers at ease.
2. Technology Immaturity 
	1. Lack of world-wide adopted Standards. Use of closed proprietary technologies. Lack of knowledge and trust. API Jungle. Legal uncertainties.
3. Data Security 
	1. Migrating workloads to a shared network and compute infrastructure increases the potential for unauthorized exposure. Authentication and access technologies become increasingly important
4. Security Management
	1.  Providers must supply easy controls to manage firewall and security settings for applications and runtime environments in the cloud.
5. Reliability
	1. High availability will be a key concern. IT departments will worry about a loss of service should outages occur. Mission critical applications may not run in the cloud without strong availability guarantees
6. Compliance
	1. Complying with SOX, HIPAA and other regulations may prohibit the use of clouds for some applications. Comprehensive auditing capabilities are essential
7. Vendor-lock in
	1. Interoperability constraints. Low level of portability of application and services based on cloud. Contract and exit strategies Limitations on sharing or transferring data

## Requirement of visualization why visualization
1. Performance isolation  
	- as we can dynamically assign and account for resources across different applications  
2. System security:  
	- as it allows isolation of services running on the same hardware 
3. Performance and reliability: 
	- as it allows applications to migrate from one platform to another 
4. The development and management of services offered by a provider
## Model of virtualization
## How difference benfit or con
## Issue of VM
1. a defense mechanism at some layer can be disabled by malware running at a layer below it.
2. It is feasible to insert a rogue VMM, a Virtual-Machine Based Rootkit (VMBR) between the physical hardware and an operating system.
3. The VMBR can enable a separate malicious OS to run surreptitiously and make this malicious OS invisible to the guest OS and to the application running under it.
4. Under the protection of the VMBR, the malicious OS could: 
	1. observe the data, the events, or the state of the target system.  
	2. run services, such as spam relays or distributed denial-of-service attacks. 
	3. interfere with the application
